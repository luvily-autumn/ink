# bordem

i've been feeling it a lot lately. like, a _lot_. i just really haven't had much to do and when i get bored i get led to crazy things. i've been working on projects left and right! yet, i still feel _bored_. why? i don't really know! i went to FBLA regionals and got 2nd place for my project, i competed because i was _bored_. sometimes, boredem leads me to cool things. another cool thing that bordem lead me to was a protest. i don't like getting politcal much, but do you know what i don't like more? **ice**. my school hosted a anti-ice protest today and that was one crazy day. 

-- will finish l8tr, sorry!
